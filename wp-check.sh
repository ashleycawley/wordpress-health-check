# A script to health-check and rate the integrity and health of a WordPress website

# Notes - ideas to implement in the future:
# - Show number of installed Plugins
# - Show any files or folders with 777 permissions
# - Check WP version with: php wp-cli.phar core check-update


# Test to see if the user is root (we don't want them to be root)
if [ `whoami` == root ]
then
	echo && echo "DO NOT run this script as root. Please run this script as the user who owns the website." && echo
